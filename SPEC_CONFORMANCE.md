# Spec Conformance Ledger

A living record of where this implementation (`amplifier-bundle-attractor`) is **off-spec**
relative to the upstream natural-language specs at [strongdm/attractor](https://github.com/strongdm/attractor),
and the chosen disposition for each gap. The goal is not 100% literal conformance — it is that
**every divergence is a deliberate, recorded choice**, trending over time toward one of:

- **ALIGN** — fix the implementation to fulfill the spec.
- **DIVERGE** — keep the implementation's behavior; record it as an intentional, documented
  divergence (and fold it into the spec / `specs/EXTENSIONS.md` so the spec stops lying).
- **IMPROVE** — implementation deliberately exceeds the spec; promote the idea upstream.

## How to use this file

1. Each gap has a stable ID (`ULM-*`, `CAL-*`, `ATX-*`), a spec reference, an impl reference,
   a **status**, and a **disposition**.
2. When you work a gap: update its status, add a dated line to the Changelog, and — if it's a
   DIVERGE/IMPROVE — make sure `specs/EXTENSIONS.md` documents the real behavior.
3. Keep evidence as `file:line`. Re-verify before flipping a status to DONE — a passing unit
   test of request translation is not the same as proven live end-to-end behavior; note which
   bar was met.

## Status legend

`OPEN` · `IN-PROGRESS` · `DONE` · `WONTFIX` (recorded divergence, no further action)

## Baseline

- Upstream specs read in full @ strongdm/attractor `fb57a55` (unified-llm 2169L, attractor 2090L,
  coding-agent-loop 1467L).
- Spec drift: our vendored `specs/` copies differ slightly from upstream (unified-llm −16L,
  attractor −2L, coding-agent-loop −16L). Only `specs/canonical/attractor-spec-canonical.md` is
  byte-identical to upstream. See `SYNC-1`.

## Summary

| Spec | Areas reviewed | Off-spec gaps | Resolved | Open |
|------|----------------|---------------|----------|------|
| unified-llm | ~35 | 13 | 4 (structured output, all providers) | 9 |
| coding-agent-loop | ~17 | 9 | 2 (bugs CAL-1, CAL-2) | 7 |
| attractor | ~29 | 7 | 1 (bug ATX-1) | 6 |

The engine layer (attractor) is the strongest — substantially a **superset** of the spec. The
material weaknesses are concentrated in the LLM client's per-provider metadata and a small set
of deliberate omissions (resume, tool-hooks, execution-environment).

## 1. unified-llm-spec → `modules/unified-llm-client`

| ID | Area | Spec | Impl | Status | Disposition |
|----|------|------|------|--------|-------------|
| ULM-1 | Gemini native structured output (`responseMimeType`+`responseSchema`) | `:988` | `adapters/gemini.py` `_translate_request` | **DONE — LIVE-PROVEN** (gemini-2.5-flash-lite) | ALIGN |
| ULM-2 | Anthropic structured-output fallback (tool-extraction) | `:989` | `adapters/anthropic.py` + `generate.py` `generate_object` | **DONE — LIVE-PROVEN** (claude-haiku-4-5) | ALIGN |
| ULM-3 | OpenAI native structured output | `:987` | `adapters/openai.py:296-313`, `openai_compat.py:453-466` | **DONE — LIVE-PROVEN** (gpt-4o-mini) | ALIGN |
| ULM-4 | `generate_object` schema-validation depth (only required-keys + root type) | `§4.5` | `generate.py` `_validate_against_schema` | OPEN | ALIGN (secondary) |
| ULM-5 | `Response.raw` never populated on success | `:599`, `:1615` | all 4 adapters now via `with_raw_response` + `_serialize_raw()` | **DONE** | ALIGN |
| ULM-6 | `RateLimitInfo` / `x-ratelimit-*` never parsed | `:1616`, `:724` | OpenAI/Anthropic/openai_compat parse headers; **Gemini deferred (SDK exposes no headers)** | **DONE (partial; Gemini N/A)** | ALIGN |
| ULM-14 | Gemini rejects unsupported JSON-Schema keywords (`additionalProperties`, `$schema`, …) in `response_schema` | live 400 INVALID_ARGUMENT | `adapters/gemini.py` `_sanitize_gemini_schema()` | **DONE** (live-found + fixed) | ALIGN |
| ULM-15 | Smoke-test/catalog staleness: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` 404s on gateway; reasoning-model smoke tests use `max_tokens=16` (0 output budget) | n/a (test fixtures + `models.json`) | catalog → `claude-sonnet-4-6` + `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`; smoke `max_tokens` 16→512 | **DONE — LIVE-PROVEN** (smoke suite 9/9 green) | ALIGN (test/catalog hygiene) |
| ULM-16 | OpenAI strict structured-output mode rejects schemas with OPTIONAL fields (`required` must list every property; objects need `additionalProperties:false`) → live `400 invalid_json_schema`. Standard JSON Schema with optional fields works on Anthropic/Gemini but 400s on OpenAI. | live eval (S4) | `adapters/_openai_strict_schema.py` `make_openai_strict_schema()` (all-required + `additionalProperties:false` + optionals→nullable), applied in `openai.py` + `openai_compat.py` | **DONE — LIVE-PROVEN** (eval OpenAI 5/6→6/6) | ALIGN |
| ULM-17 | Gemini's `additionalProperties:false` is prompt-enforced only (ULM-14 sanitizer strips the keyword; OpenAI=API-strict, Anthropic=tool-schema). Adversarial follow-up: 3 genuinely tempting "extract everything" prompts × 3-field schemas, 9 live calls → **0/3 leaked on Gemini** (and OpenAI/Anthropic). Gemini treats `properties` as the authoritative allowed-key set without the keyword. Holds under adversarial pressure for flat schemas. | live adversarial eval (`eval_gemini_extra_keys.py`) | `adapters/gemini.py` `_sanitize_gemini_schema()` | **DONE — DIVERGE confirmed (no fix; holds)** | DIVERGE |
| ULM-7 | `reasoning_effort` no-op on Anthropic & Gemini | `:691`, `:701` | only `openai.py:316`; others drop it | OPEN | ALIGN |
| ULM-8 | Anthropic `reasoning_tokens` estimate from thinking blocks | `:697` | `anthropic.py` `_map_usage` never sets it | OPEN | ALIGN |
| ULM-9 | Error message-body classification (Quota/ContextLength/ContentFilter) | `:1394-1401` | only `model_not_found`; `QuotaExceededError` never raised | OPEN | ALIGN |
| ULM-10 | Audio/Document content parts silently dropped | `:2016` | enum exists, no adapter branch | OPEN | ALIGN (fail-loud at minimum) |
| ULM-11 | Image local-file-path convenience + OpenAI `detail` hint | `:486`, `:488` | not handled | OPEN | ALIGN |
| ULM-12 | `StreamResult.partial_response` property | `:943` | missing | OPEN | ALIGN |
| ULM-13 | `AdapterTimeout` granularity (connect/request/stream_read); `stream_object` true partials | `:1043`, `:1004` | single timeout float; whole-buffer JSON parse | OPEN | ALIGN |

**Note on ULM-1/2/3:** request-translation is proven by deterministic SDK-mocked unit tests.
**Live end-to-end (does each provider actually honor the schema) is UNPROVEN** — needs real API
keys. Do not mark "live" until exercised against real providers (e.g. in a DTU with keys).

## DECIDE items — context for a future decision

Deferred by owner; not decided yet. Captured context so the future call is well-informed.
Each is currently **OPEN** with disposition pending (ALIGN vs DIVERGE).

### CAL-3 — ExecutionEnvironment abstraction (coding-agent-loop §4)
- **Spec wants:** a swappable `read_file/write_file/exec_command/grep/glob/list_directory` seam with
  Local/Docker/K8s/WASM/SSH implementations + platform metadata.
- **Reality now:** tools self-execute; no environment object is threaded; command timeouts + env
  filtering are owned by the (external) shell/bash tool. `environment.py` only builds the prompt's
  `<environment>` text block, not an execution seam.
- **Coupled to:** CAL-4 (command-timeout/env-filter wiring) and DEAD-1 (we deleted the
  command-timeout `SessionConfig` fields and pointed at the shell tool).
- **Decision hinges on:** do we need sandboxed/remote execution (Docker/SSH/WASM)? If all execution
  stays local via mounted tools → **DIVERGE** (document "tools own execution"). If we want isolation
  or remote targets → **ALIGN** (build the seam). Note Amplifier already provides isolation at a
  different layer (DTU), which may make a loop-level ExecutionEnvironment redundant.
- **Cost if ALIGN:** new abstraction crossing the tool boundary; touches every tool's call contract.

### ATX-2 — Checkpoint-based resume (attractor §5.3)
- **Spec wants:** load `checkpoint.json` → restore context/completed-nodes/retry counters → continue
  from the node after `current_node`; degrade `full`→`summary:high` one hop on resume.
- **Reality now:** engine always restarts from the start node; `checkpoint.py` is an observability
  record (explicitly "not a resume marker"); `load_checkpoint()` is never used to rehydrate.
  Idempotency is **graph-owned**: handlers skip already-done work (see `examples/pipelines/12-graph-resume`).
- **Decision hinges on:** is true crash-resume *with in-memory context restoration* needed, or is
  handler-level idempotency ("don't redo finished work") sufficient? If the latter → **DIVERGE**
  (document the graph-owned-idempotency model as the intentional design). If we need resume-after-crash
  that restores accumulated context mid-pipeline → **ALIGN**.
- **Cost if ALIGN:** real state-serialization + rehydration surface; the `full`→`summary:high`
  degrade rule; correctness testing across partial-completion states.

### ATX-3 — Tool-call hooks (attractor §9.7)
- **Spec wants:** `tool_hooks.pre` / `tool_hooks.post` shell commands wrapping every LLM tool call;
  a non-zero pre-hook exit skips the tool call.
- **Reality now:** not implemented (grep `tool_hooks` = 0). A separate `hooks-tool-truncation` module
  exists but implements output truncation, not this pre/post shell contract.
- **Decision hinges on:** do we want per-tool-call shell guards expressed at the *DOT* layer, or is
  this better served by Amplifier's existing kernel/bundle **hook** mechanism (code-decided lifecycle
  hooks)? If the kernel hook system covers the real need → **DIVERGE** (document the alternative). If
  DOT-author-level per-call guards are genuinely wanted → **ALIGN**.
- **Cost if ALIGN:** moderate; a new node/graph attribute + a guarded tool-call execution path.

## Changelog

### 2026-06-24
- **CAL-1 DONE** — `max_tool_rounds_per_input` `0 = unlimited`: loop guard now `_max_rounds <= 0 or round_count < _max_rounds` (`agent_session.py:314`); default aligned to spec `0` (`config.py:39`). Tests added; loop-agent suite 493 passed.
- **CAL-2 DONE** — `ContextLengthError` now emits `AGENT_CONTEXT_WARNING` and returns to IDLE (session stays usable) instead of `fatal_error()` → CLOSED (`agent_session.py:348`). Tests added.
- **ATX-1 DONE** — node `timeout` unit fix: consumers divide parser-ms by 1000 (`engine.py:485`, `handlers/tool.py:105`); `max_pipeline_duration` (ms) untouched. New `tests/test_node_timeout_units.py` (7 tests); loop-pipeline suite 1330 passed.
- **ULM-1/2/3 DONE (translation)** — per-provider structured output: Gemini native `response_mime_type`+`response_schema`; Anthropic tool-based extraction (`__structured_output__` forced tool_choice) with `generate_object` reading tool args; OpenAI confirmed. Fail-loud (`ConfigurationError`) on Anthropic json-without-schema. 9 tests added; unified-llm suite 636 passed. **Live end-to-end remains UNPROVEN (needs real API keys).**
- **ULM-17 DONE — DIVERGE confirmed (no fix)** — ran an adversarial extra-keys eval (3 "extract everything" prompts × 3-field `additionalProperties:false` schemas, 9 live calls): **0/3 leaked on Gemini** (and OpenAI/Anthropic). Gemini's structured-output mode treats `properties` as the authoritative allowed-key set even though our sanitizer strips the keyword. The "stripping causes leakage" hypothesis is falsified for flat schemas under adversarial pressure; the sanitizer trade-off is benign in practice. Documented as an accepted divergence; no code change. (Minor side-note, parked: when a schema's JSON-Schema `title` *metadata* shares a name with a `title` *property*, OpenAI may echo the metadata — a test-schema-design artifact, not a product bug.)
- **ULM-16 DONE — LIVE-PROVEN** — eval found OpenAI strict mode 400s on any schema with optional fields. Added `adapters/_openai_strict_schema.py::make_openai_strict_schema()` (deep-copy transform: every object → `additionalProperties:false` + `required`=all keys; originally-optional fields widened to nullable), applied in `openai.py` + `openai_compat.py` strict path; never mutates caller schema. +10 mocked tests; unified-llm suite 686 green. Live structured-output eval: OpenAI 5/6→**6/6** (Anthropic/Gemini 6/6, DOT 2/2) — re-verified by my own run.
- **ULM-17 logged (OPEN)** — eval surfaced that Gemini's `additionalProperties:false` is prompt-enforced only (ULM-14 sanitizer strips the keyword); didn't leak in the eval but the structural guarantee is absent. Disposition DIVERGE (documented sanitizer trade-off); follow-up = an adversarial extra-keys test.
- **ULM-15 DONE — LIVE-PROVEN** — refreshed Anthropic catalog (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514`→`claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`→`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`; verified live on gateway); bumped smoke `max_tokens` 16→512 (reasoning models starved at 16); updated stale-id refs in catalog/resolver unit tests. The repo's **live** integration smoke suite now passes 9/9 (was 7 failing); mocked suite 676 green. `get_latest_model("anthropic")` → `claude-sonnet-4-6`.
- **DEAD-1 DONE** — investigated wiring `tool_output_limits`/`tool_line_limits` into `hooks-tool-truncation`: NO clean seam (the hook reads its own config; the `tool:post` event payload has no limits slot; wiring would need a new cross-module channel). Per "wire-it-or-delete-it / don't invent a channel," **deleted all 5 fields** (+ getters + orphaned constants) and documented the real control points in `config.py` (truncation → `hooks-tool-truncation` config; command timeouts → shell tool, see CAL-3/CAL-4). loop-agent 478 passed; 0 references remain in source/tests. (Plan said "wire the truncation pair"; reality said no clean seam, so delete+document — the honest outcome.)
- **ATX-8 DONE (wiring)** — `response_schema` node attribute added as backward-compatible extension (EXTENSIONS §23). Promoted in `graph.py`; resolved (inline JSON or file path) in `transforms.py`; fail-loud validation; threaded to `unified_llm.generate(response_format=ResponseFormat(json_schema=...))` on the direct-LLM path (`backend.py`, `__init__.py`); spawned-agent path **fails loud** ("only supported on direct-LLM nodes yet"). Structured result stored as `outcome.notes` + parsed into `context_updates[node.id]`. 30 tests; loop-pipeline 1360 passed. **Live end-to-end UNPROVEN (needs API keys).**
- **SYNC-1 DONE** — refreshed all three `specs/canonical/*-canonical.md` to upstream `fb57a55` (byte-identical). Working `specs/*.md` left as-is (they carry local edits documented in EXTENSIONS.md).
- **Extensions documented** — added `specs/EXTENSIONS.md` §16–22 for shipped-but-unspec'd attractor features (fail-fast routing/`runs_on`, I/O contracts `requires`/`outputs`, parallel `k_of_n`/`quorum`, human `freeform`, tool `parse_json`/`tool_env`, `$param`/`${key}`, `outcome`→`preferred_label`). ATX-5 cross-referenced.
- Ledger created.
