# Adversarial Spec Review: Attractor Implementation vs NLSpec

**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Reviewers:** Three independent adversarial agents (coding-agent-loop-spec reviewer, attractor-spec reviewer, integration reviewer)
**Scope:** All source code in `amplifier-bundle-attractor/modules/` vs all three nlspec files in `specs/`
**Methodology:** Every MUST requirement traced to implementation file and line. Findings categorized as MISSING, PARTIAL, INCORRECT, UNTESTED, or DEVIATION.

---

## Executive Summary

The implementation has strong architectural foundations — 886 unit tests, real API calls proven across 2 providers, DOT parsing and pipeline traversal working. But the adversarial review found **70 total findings** (10 CRITICAL, 14 HIGH, 24 MEDIUM, 22 LOW) across three review dimensions:

| Spec | Implemented | Partial | Missing |
|---|---|---|---|
| coding-agent-loop-spec (155 requirements) | ~44% | ~17% | ~39% |
| attractor-spec (281 requirements) | ~55% | ~20% | ~25% |
| End-to-end integration | Agent loop works | Direct tool loop works | Spawn-based pipeline unproven |

**Three systemic themes:**
1. "Sessions all the way down" is architecturally sound but unproven end-to-end
2. The agent loop is ~60% of the spec — core works but many features partial/missing
3. Pipeline orchestration works for simple graphs but complex patterns have structural gaps

---

## CRITICAL Findings (10)

### C-1: `profiles={}` — Pipeline Can Never Route to the Right Provider Profile

**Source:** Integration reviewer
**Location:** `loop-pipeline/__init__.py:183-188`, consumed at `backend.py:114-116`
**Spec:** Pipeline should read `llm_provider` from each DOT node and spawn a child session with the matching provider profile.
**Implementation:** `_build_backend()` always constructs `AmplifierBackend(profiles={})`. The profiles dict is hardcoded empty. Every `session.spawn` call sends `agent_name=""`. There is no config pathway to populate this dict.
**Impact:** Per-node provider switching — a core architectural differentiator — is dead code. Every spawn attempt either crashes or creates a session with no profile.

### C-2: Three Incompatible Spawn Contracts

**Source:** Integration reviewer
**Locations:** `backend.py:204-229`, `subagent_tools.py:295`, `tool-delegate/__init__.py:853`
**Spec:** "Sessions all the way down" — pipeline spawns agent sessions, agents can spawn sub-agents.
**Implementation:** Three consumers call spawn with different signatures:

| Dimension | AmplifierBackend | SubagentManager | tool-delegate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Access | `get_capability("session.spawn")` | `coordinator.spawn()` | `get_capability("session.spawn")` |
| Return type | `dict` with output/session_id | `str` (plain text) | `dict` with output/session_id |
| Extra kwargs | agent_configs, orchestrator_config | Just instruction | tool_inheritance, hook_inheritance |

**Impact:** At least one consumer will crash at runtime due to return type mismatch.

### C-3: Spawn Path Has Zero Real E2E Coverage

**Source:** Integration reviewer
**Spec:** Pipeline spawns full agent sessions for each codergen node.
**Implementation:** All E2E tests use `DirectProviderBackend` (fallback). Zero tests exercise: pipeline → AmplifierBackend → real `session.spawn` → child loop-agent → real provider → tool execution → result propagation back to pipeline.
**Impact:** The intended architecture has never been run end-to-end.

### C-4: No Tool Output Truncation Wired Into Agent Loop

**Source:** Agent reviewer + Integration reviewer
**Spec Section 5:** Two-pass truncation (character then line) with per-tool limits. TOOL_CALL_END carries full output, LLM receives truncated.
**Implementation:** `hooks-tool-truncation` module exists with 34 tests, but no test wires it into an `AgentSession` and verifies the `tool:post` event fires and modifies output before it reaches the provider.
**Impact:** A single large file read (>50KB) can blow out the context window. Silent failure — no crash, just ballooning costs and eventual context length errors.

### C-5: No Abort Signal

**Source:** Agent reviewer
**Spec Section 2.4:** "The host can signal cancellation at any time. The current LLM stream is closed, running processes killed, session → CLOSED."
**Implementation:** `AgentSession` has `shutdown()` but no `abort()` method. No mechanism for the host to interrupt a running `process_input()` call. No `CancellationToken` or `asyncio.Event` checked during the loop.
**Impact:** Runaway agents cannot be stopped. Long tool executions or LLM calls block until natural completion.

### C-6: No Tool Argument Validation

**Source:** Agent reviewer
**Spec Section 4.1, Step 2:** "VALIDATE arguments against the tool's JSON Schema."
**Implementation:** Tool arguments from the LLM are passed directly to `tool.execute()` without schema validation. Invalid arguments reach the tool's execute method unchecked.
**Impact:** Malformed tool arguments cause unpredictable tool behavior instead of clean error messages back to the LLM.

### C-7: AWAITING_INPUT State Is Dead Code

**Source:** Agent reviewer
**Spec Section 2.3:** State machine includes PROCESSING → AWAITING_INPUT when model asks a question (text-only, question-like response).
**Implementation:** `SessionState.AWAITING_INPUT` exists in the enum and transition table, but no code path ever triggers the `await_input()` transition. When the model responds with text only (no tool calls), the session always goes IDLE, never AWAITING_INPUT.
**Impact:** The host application can never distinguish between "agent completed" and "agent is asking a question."

### C-8: Streaming Drops Reasoning Content

**Source:** Agent reviewer
**Location:** `agent_session.py` streaming path
**Spec:** Response captures `reasoning` field from LLM output.
**Implementation:** The streaming path (`_call_provider_streaming`) assembles text from chunks but does not capture ThinkingBlock content. The `_extract_reasoning()` helper is only called in the non-streaming path.
**Impact:** For thinking-enabled models (Claude with extended thinking, OpenAI o-series), reasoning content is silently lost during streaming.

### C-9: No ProviderProfile / Tool Registry

**Source:** Agent reviewer
**Spec Section 3:** ProviderProfile interface with `tool_registry`, `build_system_prompt()`, `tools()`, `provider_options()`, capability flags.
**Implementation:** No ProviderProfile class exists. Tools come from whatever the bundle mounts. System prompt assembly is hardcoded in `agent_session.py`. No capability flags (`supports_parallel_tool_calls`, `context_window_size`).
**Impact:** The agent can't adapt behavior based on provider capabilities. All providers treated identically regardless of their actual features.

### C-10: 5 of 13 Validation Lint Rules Missing

**Source:** Pipeline reviewer
**Spec Section 7.2:** 13 lint rules defined, including 2 at ERROR level.
**Implementation:** 8 rules implemented. Missing: `condition_syntax` (ERROR), `stylesheet_syntax` (ERROR), `type_known` (WARNING), `fidelity_valid` (WARNING), `retry_target_exists` (WARNING).
**Impact:** Invalid condition expressions and stylesheet syntax pass validation and crash at runtime.

---

## HIGH Findings (14)

### H-1: SESSION_END Timing Wrong

**Location:** `agent_session.py`
**Spec:** SESSION_END emitted only when BOTH the loop exits AND the follow-up queue is empty.
**Implementation:** SESSION_END emitted before follow-up processing.
**Impact:** Host apps get premature completion signal.

### H-2: No ExecutionEnvironment Abstraction

**Spec Section 4:** Abstract `ExecutionEnvironment` interface with `read_file()`, `write_file()`, `exec_command()`, etc.
**Implementation:** Tools execute directly on the local filesystem. No abstraction layer for Docker/K8s/WASM/SSH.
**Impact:** Cannot run agents in isolated execution environments.

### H-3: Forced Parallel Tool Execution

**Spec Section 4.1:** Parallel only when `provider_profile.supports_parallel_tool_calls` is true.
**Implementation:** Always uses `asyncio.gather()` for multiple tool calls regardless of provider.
**Impact:** Providers that don't support parallel tool calls may receive results in unexpected order.

### H-4: `loop_restart` Edge Attribute Unimplemented

**Spec Section 3.2, Step 7:** "IF next_edge has loop_restart=true: restart_run()"
**Location:** `engine.py:244-272`
**Implementation:** After edge selection, engine just advances to next node. No check for `loop_restart`, no restart logic.
**Impact:** Cycle-based pipeline patterns silently don't work.

### H-5: Manager Loop Wrong Architecture

**Spec Section 4.11:** Manager loads `stack.child_dotfile` and runs a separate child pipeline.
**Implementation:** `manager_loop.py:103-116` runs a subgraph of the SAME graph via outgoing edges.
**Impact:** The supervisor pattern is fundamentally different from spec — re-runs part of the same graph instead of a separate pipeline.

### H-6: Per-Node Failure Routing Missing Outside Goal Gates

**Spec Section 3.7:** On FAIL: try fail edge → retry_target → fallback_retry_target → terminate.
**Location:** `engine.py:244-260`
**Implementation:** On `edge is None`, immediately returns FAIL. Does NOT check retry_target or fallback_retry_target.
**Impact:** Nodes that fail and have no matching edge terminate the pipeline even if they have retry targets configured.

### H-7: Transform Ordering Wrong

**Spec Section 9.1:** "Transforms applied after parsing and before validation."
**Implementation:** `__init__.py:243-246` validates FIRST, then `engine.py:94-95` applies transforms during `run()`. Order is parse → validate → execute(transform → ...) instead of parse → transform → validate → execute.
**Impact:** A stylesheet that fixes an invalid model config would still fail validation.

### H-8: Multi-Class Stylesheet Matching Broken

**Spec Section 2.12:** Classes are comma-separated, selectable individually with dot-prefix.
**Location:** `stylesheet.py:174-175`
**Implementation:** `sel[1:] == node_class` does exact string equality. `.code` won't match `class="code,critical"`.
**Impact:** Multi-class nodes can never be matched by individual class selectors.

### H-9: Fidelity Not Wired Into Engine

**Spec Section 5.4:** Fidelity resolution at each node transition.
**Implementation:** Engine never calls `resolve_fidelity()`. Only works in `AmplifierBackend` path, which has zero E2E coverage (see C-3).
**Impact:** In the working code path (DirectProviderBackend), fidelity is completely bypassed.

### H-10: Pipeline Events Missing Entire Categories

**Spec Section 9.6:** 14+ event types across 4 categories.
**Implementation:** 8 event constants. Missing all parallel events (4), human events (3), retry-specific events (2).
**Impact:** No observability for parallel execution, human interaction, or retry attempts.

### H-11: `subgraph_runner` Never Wired

**Location:** `handlers/__init__.py:62-73`
**Implementation:** `HandlerRegistry` constructed with only `backend=`. `ParallelHandler` and `ManagerLoopHandler` read `kwargs.get("subgraph_runner")` which is always `None`.
**Impact:** Parallel and manager-loop nodes cannot execute subgraphs. Silently fail.

### H-12: Standalone Module Repos Diverged From Bundle Copies

**Location:** `amplifier-module-loop-agent/` vs `amplifier-bundle-attractor/modules/loop-agent/`
**Implementation:** Bundle copy has 713-line agent_session.py with streaming, provider resolution, 5-layer prompt. Standalone has 499 lines without any of that. Standalone is missing subagent_tools.py entirely.
**Impact:** Anyone installing from standalone git URL gets a broken, 214-line-shorter version.

### H-13: E2E Profile Missing System Prompt Context

**Location:** `profiles/attractor-e2e-anthropic.yaml`
**Implementation:** No `context:` section. E2E tests run with hardcoded fallback: "You are a coding agent." (5 words) instead of the 65-line provider-aligned prompt.
**Impact:** E2E tests don't validate the real system prompt works correctly.

### H-14: Pipeline E2E Tests Don't Exercise DOT Fixtures

**Location:** `tests/e2e/run_e2e.sh`
**Implementation:** All 3 bash E2E tests use `--mode single` (agent-only). The pipeline profile and DOT fixtures exist but are never invoked by any E2E test.
**Impact:** Pipeline orchestration never tested end-to-end by the test infrastructure.

## What the E2E Tests Actually Proved

| Proven | Method |
|---|---|
| loop-agent creates files via real Anthropic API | E2E Test 1 |
| loop-agent reads + edits files (multi-tool chain) | E2E Test 2 |
| loop-agent executes shell commands | E2E Test 3 |

| NOT Proven | Why |
|---|---|
| Pipeline spawns real child sessions (sessions all the way down) | Used DirectProviderBackend fallback |
| Provider profile switching per pipeline node | profiles={} means this is dead code |
| Streaming events flow during real usage | E2E tests didn't check streaming events |
| Tool truncation fires during real usage | Hook wiring never validated in integration |
| Subagent tools work with real sessions | Mocked coordinator only |
| Abort/cancellation works | No abort mechanism exists |
| AWAITING_INPUT surfaced to host | Dead code |
| Complex pipeline patterns (parallel, manager, conditional retry) | Unit tests with mocks only |
