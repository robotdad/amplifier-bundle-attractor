    Notes on omitted fields:
    - Command execution timeouts (default/max): owned by the external
      shell/bash tool modules, not by loop-agent (relates to CAL-3/CAL-4
      ExecutionEnvironment gap).
    - Per-tool output char limits and line limits: configured on the
      hooks-tool-truncation module via its own hook config block
      (char_limits / line_limits keys). loop-agent has no channel into
      the truncation hook's config — do not add those fields here.
