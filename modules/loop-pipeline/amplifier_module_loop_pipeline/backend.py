"""AmplifierBackend — CodergenBackend adapter using session spawning.

This is the "sessions all the way down" integration point. When the
pipeline engine hits a codergen node, the CodergenHandler calls this
backend, which spawns a coding agent sub-session via the Amplifier
``session.spawn`` capability.

When session.spawn is not available, falls back to a direct provider
mini tool loop that calls LLM → execute tool calls → repeat until the
model returns a text-only response.

Spec coverage: Section 4.5 (CodergenBackend Interface), Section 1.4,
               FID-001–010, Section 5.4.

fidelity=full continuity (see docs/designs/fidelity-full-session-continuity.md):
  ``_thread_transcripts`` maps a branch-local thread_key to a list of
  (node_id, instruction, output) triples — the accumulated node-exchange
  history for that thread.  After each ``full`` node, the exchange is
  appended (truncating any stale tail first, for goal-gate-retry
  idempotency).  On the next same-thread ``full`` node the history is
  converted to a ``parent_messages`` list (user/assistant roles) and
  passed to a FRESH spawn — never a session_id re-pass.  This removes
  the type confusion (id-where-a-conversation-belongs) that caused the
  continuity bug.

  Thread_id is branch-local: ``clone()`` resets ``_thread_transcripts``
  so parallel branches each start with a fresh transcript even when they
  share an explicit ``thread_id``.  See EXTENSIONS.md §12–13.

        Implements **truncate-to-node-then-append** for goal-gate-retry

        prior attempt in the same run), all turns from that node onwards are
        removed before the new turn is appended.  This means a re-run node
        *replaces* its prior exchange rather than duplicating it.

        Algorithm:
            1. Scan the current transcript for the first tuple whose node_id
               matches the incoming node_id.
            2. If found at position i: truncate the list to the first i entries
               (discarding that node and all subsequent nodes' entries).
            3. Append the new triple (node_id, instruction, output).

        Called with role=user/assistant only (system/developer roles are
        stripped at this layer, matching app-cli behavior).

        Thread_id is branch-local (EXTENSIONS.md §13): ``clone()`` resets
        ``_thread_transcripts`` so sibling parallel branches each maintain
        independent transcripts even when they share an explicit thread_id.

        Note on sequentiality (§3.8 / design §2):
            Same-thread-key full nodes within a single branch always run
            sequentially (the engine while-loop is sequential; parallel
            branches each receive an isolated backend clone).  No asyncio
