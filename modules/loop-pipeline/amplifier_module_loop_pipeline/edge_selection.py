"""Five-step edge selection algorithm for pipeline routing.

After a node completes, the engine selects the next edge using a
deterministic priority order:

1. Condition-matching edges (evaluated against outcome + context)
2. Preferred label match (from outcome.preferred_label)
3. Suggested next IDs (from outcome.suggested_next_ids)
4. Highest weight among unconditional edges
5. Lexical tiebreak on target node ID

Spec coverage: ESEL-001–010, Section 3.3.
