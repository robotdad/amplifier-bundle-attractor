        Returns True if a checkpoint was loaded (resume mode), False otherwise.

        silently restarting would re-execute side-effecting nodes (git pushes,
        branch creates, file writes) that have already been applied.

        Three checkpoint formats are handled:

        1. Pre-identity (no ``identity`` field, no ``graph_fingerprint``):
           One-time migration — discard with an info-level log message; treat as
           "no checkpoint exists."  NOT a hard-fail: these checkpoints predate
           the identity guard entirely.

        2. Wave-0 #252 format (top-level ``graph_fingerprint`` string):
           Promoted into a RunIdentity and checked normally.  Mismatch → hard-fail.

        3. T2.4 format (``identity`` dict):
           Standard path.  Mismatch → hard-fail.

        Resume re-runs are scoped to nodes after the last completed_node.
        Idempotency of side-effecting handlers is the handler's responsibility,
        NOT the engine's.  See ``docs/designs/RECURRING-BUG-CLASSES.md``
