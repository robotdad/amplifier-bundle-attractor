"""Conditional node handler.

A no-op that returns SUCCESS immediately.  Diamond nodes (shape=diamond)
are routing nodes; the engine's edge-selection algorithm (§3.3) handles
actual routing from the diamond node based on outgoing edge conditions.
The handler itself performs no work.

Spec coverage: Section 4.7 (ConditionalHandler).

Node attributes:
    None — this handler is intentionally attribute-free.
