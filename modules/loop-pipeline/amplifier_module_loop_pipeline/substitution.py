"""Unified context substitution for pipeline attribute strings.

M5: Single substitution policy shared by tool, human, and transforms handlers.

Resolution table:
  ${key}  (brace form)  — any chars including dots; present → value, absent → literal
  $key    (bare form)   — any key including dotted; present → value, absent → literal
  $$                    — escape sequence → literal "$"

Both forms accept dotted keys (e.g. ${tool.output}, $tool.output).
Absent keys leave the token unchanged (literal pass-through).  No exceptions
are raised on missing keys; failures are caught by the engine's eager scan
(M2) before handlers run.

Key ordering: longest keys replaced first to avoid partial matches when a
shorter key is a prefix of a longer one (e.g. "tool" vs "tool.output").

Spec note (§4.5):
    The NLSpec defines ``$goal`` as the only template variable in codergen
    handler prompts.  M5 generalises this to all context keys in
    tool_command strings — a conscious extension beyond the written spec.

Implications for pipeline authors:
    When a tool_command runs under ``set -eu`` bash, any token whose key
    is absent from context survives as a literal string (e.g. the four
    characters ``$foo``).  Bash then treats it as an unbound shell variable
    and exits with "parameter not set" (exit 2).

    The universally-portable defence is shell-default syntax in the bash::

        ${optional_var:-fallback_value}

    This works regardless of invocation path — dot-graph resolver,
    attractor-as-tool in an AmplifierSession, custom resolver, or
    ``attractor run`` CLI.  No upstream abstraction layer needs to be
    relied upon.

Implications for resolver authors:
    Resolvers MAY pre-seed context with declared defaults from their own
    schema before the engine runs (e.g. the dot-graph resolver reads
    ``default:`` fields from resolver.yaml and injects them into context
    at dispatch time).  This is an enhancement on top of the universal
    shell-default baseline, not a replacement for it.

Three-layer default pattern:
    1. Universal floor — shell defaults in bash (works for all consumers).
    2. Bridge enforcement — resolver seeds context with schema-declared
       defaults at dispatch (protects direct API callers that bypass UI).
    3. UI affordance — resolver emits A2UI ``defaultValue`` on schema
       components so users see pre-filled fields without knowing the
       underlying attractor mechanics.

    The engine participates only at layer 1, via the absent-key
    pass-through described above.  Layers 2 and 3 are resolver concerns.
