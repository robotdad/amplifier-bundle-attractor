"""Integration tests for the CodergenHandler → AmplifierBackend continuity wiring.

These tests exercise the REAL path that production uses: the engine /
run_subgraph invoke ``CodergenHandler.execute(node, context, graph, logs_root)``,
and the handler must forward ``graph`` into ``backend.run(...)`` so that the
fidelity=full transcript store/read gates (which require ``graph is not None``)
actually fire.

The earlier unit tests in test_backend_full_continuity.py passed ``graph``
straight into ``backend.run`` — they proved the mechanism but never the
handler→backend wiring.  A live DTU run revealed the gap: seeds wrote their
codewords but recall came back empty, because ``CodergenHandler.execute``
called ``backend.run(node, prompt, context)`` with only 3 args, leaving
``graph=None`` and silently skipping the transcript path.

Design: docs/designs/fidelity-full-session-continuity.md
Spec coverage: §5.4 (full fidelity), §4.5 (backend interface).
