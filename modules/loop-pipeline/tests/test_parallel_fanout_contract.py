"""Lock the parallel fan-out contract for shape=component and shape=parallelogram.

Spec coverage: §2.8 (shape-to-handler mapping), §3.3 (select_edge algorithm),
§3.8 (concurrency model), §4.8 (ParallelHandler).

Two contract assertions:

1. shape=component + unconditional outgoing edges → fan-out (ParallelHandler
   dispatches ALL outgoing edges concurrently).  The spec (§3.8) states:
   "Parallelism exists within specific node handlers (parallel, parallel.fan_in)
   that manage concurrent execution internally."

2. shape=parallelogram + unconditional outgoing edges → single-edge selection
   (ToolHandler executes the tool_command; then the engine's 5-step select_edge
   algorithm (§3.3) runs and returns exactly ONE edge: best_by_weight_then_lexical,
   which is the lexically-first target node ID when weights are equal).

These two behaviors are adjacent and easily confused.  Test 2 fills a coverage
gap: without it, authoring a parallelogram fork expecting fan-out will silently
discard the second branch and complete on half the data.
