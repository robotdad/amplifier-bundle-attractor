# Attractor Extensions

Documented divergences and additions relative to the canonical attractor nlspec at
[github.com/strongdm/attractor](https://github.com/strongdm/attractor). The current
canonical snapshot lives at `specs/canonical/attractor-spec-canonical.md`.

**All extensions are backward-compatible with the canonical spec — community `.dot` files
written against the canonical spec should continue to work without modification.**

When in doubt about whether a behavior is spec-conformant, consult the canonical snapshot
before assuming it is a bug.

## 1. BareValue Grammar Production

**What:** The value grammar accepts unquoted bare identifiers in addition to quoted strings.
Examples: `shape=box`, `rankdir=LR`, `node_type=llm`. The grammar production is:

```
BareValue ::= [A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_.:-]*
```

**Why:** Graphviz DOT source uses bare identifiers pervasively for built-in shape and
direction attributes. Requiring quotes everywhere would break existing community `.dot`
files. This is an additive clarification of what Graphviz already accepts; it is not a
departure from spec intent.

**Compatibility:** Fully backward-compatible. Quoted values continue to work unchanged.

---

## 2. `default_max_retries` (with Legacy Alias `default_max_retry`)

**What:** The graph-level retry ceiling attribute is `default_max_retries` (plural). The
singular `default_max_retry` is accepted as a legacy alias and maps to the same behavior.
Default value is `0` (no retries unless explicitly configured).

**Why:** The plural form is grammatically clearer ("the number of retries" rather than "the
maximum retry"). The legacy alias ensures any existing `.dot` files using the original
singular name continue to work without modification.

**Compatibility:** Both names are valid. Prefer `default_max_retries` in new pipelines.

---

## 3. `max_retries` Node Attribute Inherits Graph-Level Default

**What:** When a node omits the `max_retries` attribute, it inherits the graph's
`default_max_retries` value rather than defaulting to `0` independently. This allows a
single graph-level setting to establish a retry policy for all nodes simultaneously.

**Why:** Without inheritance, authors must repeat `max_retries=N` on every node that
should participate in a retry policy. The inheritance behavior is the natural complement to
`default_max_retries` existing at all: a graph-level default that nothing inherits would
serve no purpose.

**Compatibility:** Only observable in pipelines that set `default_max_retries` at the
graph level. Pipelines that do not set it see no change (effective retries remain 0).

---

## 4. `goal_gate` Accepts `PARTIAL_SUCCESS`

**What:** A node marked `goal_gate=true` is considered satisfied by either `SUCCESS` or
`PARTIAL_SUCCESS` outcome status. It is NOT satisfied by `FAIL`, `SKIP`, or other
statuses, and the pipeline exits with an unsatisfied-goal error if the node does not
reach at least `PARTIAL_SUCCESS`.

**Why:** Rigid `SUCCESS`-only gate semantics are too coarse for pipelines that implement
best-effort or iterative workflows — for example, a test-generation node that passes most
cases but flags a few as needing human review. Accepting `PARTIAL_SUCCESS` preserves the
gate intent (the node ran and made meaningful progress) while not blocking pipelines that
legitimately reach a partial outcome.

**Compatibility:** Existing `goal_gate=true` nodes that return `SUCCESS` are unaffected.
Nodes that return `PARTIAL_SUCCESS` now satisfy the gate where they previously would have
caused a pipeline failure.

---

## 5. Explicit TRANSFORM Phase in Execution Lifecycle

**What:** The execution lifecycle includes six phases rather than five:

```
PARSE -> TRANSFORM -> VALIDATE -> INITIALIZE -> EXECUTE -> FINALIZE
```

The TRANSFORM phase applies parse-time transforms (stylesheet resolution, variable
expansion, and custom AST transforms) before validation runs.

**Why:** Placing transforms before validation ensures that validation sees the final,
expanded graph — not the template form with unexpanded variables or unresolved stylesheets.
This prevents spurious validation failures on legal pipeline patterns that are valid only
after expansion.

**Compatibility:** Pipeline authors who consume the execution lifecycle events or hook into
the lifecycle will see a new `TRANSFORM` phase event before `VALIDATE`. Pipelines that do
not hook into lifecycle events are unaffected.

---

## 6. Error Semantics: `RETURN Outcome(status=FAIL)` vs `RAISE`

**What:** Handler error paths use `RETURN Outcome(status=FAIL, ...)` rather than raising
exceptions. Unhandled exceptions in handler code are caught and wrapped into a `FAIL`
outcome with the exception message in `notes`.

**Why:** Exception propagation from a handler would terminate the entire pipeline rather
than routing through the graph's conditional edges. Returning a `FAIL` outcome preserves
the pipeline's ability to dispatch to a failure branch (e.g., a `condition="outcome=fail"`
edge to a recovery node or human gate). This is the behavior authors expect: a failed node
should trigger failure-path routing, not crash the pipeline.

**Compatibility:** This is an implementation detail of the engine. Pipeline authors observe
`FAIL` outcomes on handler errors regardless of whether the internal mechanism uses
exceptions or return values. Existing pipelines are unaffected.

---

## 7. `type` vs `node_type` Internal Naming

**What:** The externally visible DOT attribute name for the node handler type is `type`.
The engine may use an internal field named `node_type` to avoid reserved-word conflicts in
Python (where `type` is a built-in). Both names refer to the same concept; the external
behavior is identical.

**Why:** Python's `type` built-in creates naming conflicts in dataclasses and attribute
access. Using `node_type` internally avoids shadowing the built-in. The DOT attribute name
`type` remains canonical and externally visible.

**Compatibility:** Pipeline authors use `type=llm`, `type=parallel`, etc. in DOT source.
The internal renaming is invisible at the DOT level.

---

## 8. Per-Branch Session Isolation for Full-Fidelity Threading

**What:** Our implementation realizes the spec's §5.4 `full`-fidelity "reused session / same
thread" behavior via an internal `_session_pool` on the backend \u2014 an implementation construct
below the spec's `CodergenBackend` `run(node, prompt, context)` interface (the spec models no
session object). As of this change, when a node executes inside a **parallel branch**, its
session pool and completion-tracking state are **isolated per branch**: each branch runs on a
branch-scoped engine with a cloned backend. Concurrent branches no longer share session state.

**Why:** §3.8 mandates that "each parallel branch receives an isolated clone of the context."
Our `_session_pool` sits below the spec's abstraction, so the spec does not explicitly govern
it \u2014 but sharing it across concurrent branches violated the spec's isolation *intent* and our
own §4.12 handler-statelessness rule, producing silent non-deterministic cross-branch
contamination under `fidelity=full`. Per-branch isolation extends the spec's isolation intent
down to our session-pool layer.

**Compatibility:** Fully backward-compatible. Sequential pipelines and parallel pipelines
without nested stateful codegen see no change. No spec-conformant `.dot` file can depend on
cross-branch session sharing, because the spec never defines that behavior \u2014 it defines the
opposite (§3.8 isolation). This change moves observable behavior toward what a conforming
pipeline already assumes.

> **Implementation note:** `_session_pool` was superseded by `_thread_transcripts` (see §12–13); the per-branch isolation semantics described here remain in effect.

---

## 9. Same `thread_id` Across Concurrent Branches Resolves to Isolation

**What:** The spec contains an unresolved interaction: §5.4 thread-resolution says nodes
sharing a `thread_id` "reuse the same LLM session," while §3.8 says parallel branches must be
isolated. When the **same explicit `thread_id` appears on nodes in two different concurrent
parallel branches**, these two rules conflict. Our implementation resolves this by giving
**§3.8 (branch isolation) precedence**: each branch's nodes get an isolated session even if
they carry an identical `thread_id` to a sibling branch's nodes. Thread-id-based session reuse
continues to work normally for the **sequential** case (nodes in the same linear path).

**Why:** §3.8's isolation mandate is the stronger, more consistent guarantee; a shared LLM
session across concurrent branches is precisely the contamination this change eliminates.
"Isolate by default" is the safe, deterministic resolution of a spec self-contradiction.

**Compatibility:** Backward-compatible for all spec-conformant pipelines except the narrow,
spec-self-contradictory case of an author deliberately placing the same `thread_id` on nodes
in different concurrent branches expecting them to share one session \u2014 a behavior the spec
never coherently defines. Such a pipeline relies on undefined/contradictory behavior; we make
the resolution explicit and deterministic here.

---

## 10. `shape=folder` / `dot_file=` Sub-Pipeline Nodes

**What:** We support a sub-pipeline node declared via `shape=folder` with a `dot_file=`
attribute, which runs an entire child `.dot` graph as a single node's execution. The spec
describes sub-pipeline composition as a *pattern* (§9.4 \u2014 "a node whose handler runs an entire
sub-graph as its execution," with the manager loop named as the example) but does not define a
dedicated `shape=folder` shape or `dot_file=` attribute for it.

**Why:** A first-class folder/sub-pipeline node is ergonomic for composing pipelines from
reusable `.dot` fragments without the manager-loop supervisor machinery. It implements the
spec's §9.4 sub-pipeline pattern with a dedicated, declarative shape.

**Compatibility:** Additive and non-shadowing. `folder` is not a spec-assigned shape in the
§2.8 shape\u2192handler table, and `dot_file` does not collide with any spec-defined attribute
name, so the mechanism cannot change the behavior of any spec-conformant `.dot` file.
(Documenting a pre-existing extension that was previously undocumented.)

## 11. Sub-Pipeline and Manager-Child Execution Is a Fresh Session Boundary

**What:** Same-`thread_id` LLM session continuity (§5.4 thread resolution) applies WITHIN a
single graph traversal. It does NOT cross a sub-pipeline boundary: a node inside a
`shape=folder` / `dot_file=` sub-pipeline (§9.4) or a manager-loop child dotfile (§4.11) runs
as a separate child graph/engine and starts a fresh LLM session, even if it carries the same
`thread_id` as a node in the parent graph. Session continuity for a shared `thread_id` holds
for inline nodes and flattened DOT `subgraph cluster_*` blocks (which §11.1 flattens into the
same graph), but not across a child-graph execution boundary.

**Why:** The spec frames sessions as run-local and non-serializable (§5.3: "in-memory LLM
sessions cannot be serialized"; §3.1 finalize closes sessions), the thread-resolution ladder
is graph-scoped (§5.4, tier 3 is "graph-level default thread"), and §9.4 defines a
sub-pipeline as "a node whose handler runs an entire sub-graph as its execution" — a separate
execution unit. This matches the subagent model (coding-agent-loop §7.1: a child session "runs
its own agentic loop with its own conversation history but shares the parent's execution
environment"). Our implementation makes this concrete: a sub-pipeline / manager child runs on
a child engine with its own session pool. The spec does not explicitly state cross-sub-pipeline
continuity either way; we adopt "fresh boundary" as the deterministic, spec-intent-aligned
choice, consistent with the per-branch isolation decisions in sections 8 and 9.

**Compatibility:** Backward-compatible. No spec-conformant `.dot` can depend on
cross-sub-pipeline session continuity, because the spec never promises it and the surrounding
normative clauses (§5.3, §5.4, §9.4) indicate the opposite. Authors who need a node to continue
a shared-`thread_id` session must keep it inline in the same graph (or in a flattened cluster),
not behind a sub-pipeline / folder / manager-child boundary.

---

## 12. `fidelity=full` Continuity Is Realized via `parent_messages` at Node-Exchange Granularity

**What:** The spec's §5.4 `full`-fidelity "reuse the same session / full history preserved"
requirement is realized in our implementation by a backend-held message-list carrier injected
into each subsequent same-thread spawn via the `parent_messages` mechanism (foundation
`_prepared.py` §4.5 leave-open). The carrier holds **node-exchange granularity**: one
`(role=user, content=instruction)` + `(role=assistant, content=final_output)` pair per `full`
node. The child agent's inner tool-loop turns are **not** included — only the conversation
*between* nodes is preserved, not the child's internal reasoning.

**Why:** The spec's §5.4 language ("reuse the same LLM session", "full history preserved") is
written as a *behavior specification*, not a mechanism mandate. The spec separately notes
(§5.3) that sessions are in-memory and non-serializable, and unified-llm §2.6 models the LLM
client as stateless (continuity = caller-passed message list). Our realization of §5.4 using
`parent_messages` is mechanism-not-policy: the spec's §4.5 CodergenBackend interface is
silent on how continuity is achieved, leaving this to the app layer. Node-exchange granularity
(instruction + final output) was accepted as the meaning of `full` at the backend layer — the
spawn result exposes only `output` + `session_id`, not inner tool-loop turns, so inner-turn
fidelity across nodes is architecturally inaccessible at this layer.

**Compatibility:** Additive and non-breaking. Prior behavior (sub_session_id re-pass) was
silently broken — it never preserved history because session_id is an identity/trace token,
not a history pointer. This change restores the spec-mandated behavior. No spec-conformant
`.dot` file can depend on the broken non-continuity.

---

## 13. `thread_id` Is Branch-Local — Same `thread_id` in Sibling Branches Does Not Join Conversations

**What:** `fidelity=full` session continuity (§5.4 thread resolution) is *branch-local*: the
backend's `_thread_transcripts` carrier is reset to `{}` when a backend is cloned for a
parallel branch (`clone()`). Two sibling branches that both carry an explicit `thread_id`
**do not share conversation history** — each branch accumulates its own independent
transcript. Thread-id-based history continuity operates only within a single linear path
(i.e., a single branch's sequential execution).

**Why:** This resolves the same §5.4 vs §3.8 spec conflict addressed in §9 (per-branch
session-pool isolation): §3.8 isolation (each parallel branch receives an independent clone)
takes precedence over §5.4 thread-id-based reuse when the two rules conflict. Isolation is
the deterministic, safe resolution — a shared conversation across concurrent branches is
precisely the cross-contamination the per-branch isolation design eliminates. The transcript
isolation is a natural consequence of the backend clone resetting mutable state.

**Compatibility:** Backward-compatible. The prior implementation was broken for cross-node
continuity regardless of branching, so no existing pipeline could have been relying on
cross-branch conversation sharing. Authors who intend a shared thread to carry history across
nodes must place those nodes in the same sequential path (not in sibling parallel branches).

---

## 14. `allow_partial` Applies on Node Timeout, Not Only Retry Exhaustion

**What:** The canonical spec scopes `allow_partial` (§2.6) to a single trigger: "Accept
PARTIAL_SUCCESS when retries are exhausted instead of failing" (§5.2 retry pseudocode). We
extend it to a second trigger: when a node with `allow_partial` set exceeds its `timeout`
(§2.6), the engine yields `PARTIAL_SUCCESS` instead of `FAIL`. Because `PARTIAL_SUCCESS` is
success-class for routing (§5.2), the graph continues along the timed-out node's unconditional
edge rather than terminating the run. Without `allow_partial`, a timeout still produces `FAIL`
and flows through normal failure routing (§3.7) — unchanged.

**Why:** For iterative loops (a node meant to make incremental progress across many
executions, with progress recorded in context/files), a single slow iteration hitting its
timeout would otherwise tear down the entire run via §3.7 termination. `allow_partial` is the
author's explicit opt-in that an incomplete-but-progressing node is "good enough to proceed" —
the same intent the spec already honors for retry exhaustion and that §4 honors for goal gates.
Applying it on the timeout path extends that intent to the one other place a node can fail to
fully complete. The behavior is gated entirely behind the opt-in attribute; nodes without it
see no change.

**Note on attribute spelling:** This extension also corrects a string-vs-bool defect at the
`allow_partial` call sites. The DOT parser coerces *unquoted* `allow_partial=true` to bool
`True` but leaves *quoted* `allow_partial="true"` as the string `"true"`; the call sites
previously tested `attrs.get("allow_partial") is True`, which never matched the quoted form —
so `allow_partial` was inert for the common quoted spelling on both the retry-exhaustion and
timeout paths. Both call sites now accept bool `True` or the string `"true"`, so both DOT
spellings behave identically (consistent with extension §1, BareValue, where quoted and
unquoted values are equivalent).

**Compatibility:** Fully backward-compatible. Nodes without `allow_partial` are unaffected
(timeout still routes via §3.7). Nodes that set it now continue past a timeout where they
previously terminated the run — moving observable behavior toward the author's stated intent.
No spec-conformant `.dot` file can depend on the prior "single timeout kills the graph despite
`allow_partial`" behavior, since that was the defect this corrects.
